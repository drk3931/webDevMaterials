take for example
col-3. This will turn into col-md-3 or col-lg-3 or col-sm-3 depending on the devices

note that
col-sm-3 will become col-md-3 on a larger device and col-lg-3 on an even bigger device



desktop
d-none d-lg-block
this blocks this element from displaying on medium and down

tablet
d-none d-sm-block
this blocks this element from displaying on small and down (xs)

small phone only 
d-sm-none 
so it wont display for anything larger than xs (sm+)
Note that extra small width devices like the iphone require that you use the col-x tag.
